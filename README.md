# Iris Classification: Task 1 - Data Preprocessing

This repository contains the first task of my Machine Learning internship, focusing on the preprocessing of the famous Iris Dataset.

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this task is to clean and prepare the Iris dataset for machine learning models. Proper preprocessing ensures that the data is scaled, balanced, and ready for accurate classification.

## 📂 Dataset Information
The dataset used is the **Iris Dataset**, which includes 150 samples of iris flowers from three different species:
* Iris-setosa
* Iris-versicolor
* Iris-virginica

**Features:**
1. Sepal Length (cm)
2. Sepal Width (cm)
3. Petal Length (cm)
4. Petal Width (cm)

## 🛠️ Tasks Performed
* **Data Loading:** Importing the dataset using Pandas.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Checking for missing values and understanding data distribution.
* **Data Cleaning:** Handling any inconsistencies in the dataset.
* **Feature Scaling:** Using standard techniques to normalize the feature ranges.
* **Data Splitting:** Dividing the dataset into Training and Testing sets (80/20 split).

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/ridhisharma-ai/DATA-PREPROCESSING.git](https://github.com/ridhisharma-ai/DATA-PREPROCESSING.git)
2. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r Requirements.txt
3. Open Data_preprocessing.ipynb in VS Code or Jupyter Notebook and run the cells.
